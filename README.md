## Flask Application Design for a YouTube-Like Frontend

### HTML Files

The frontend will require multiple HTML files to achieve the desired UI and design:

- **base.html**: This file will contain the basic structure of the web page, including the header, navigation bar, and footer, which will be used as a template for other pages.
- **index.html**: This is the main landing page that displays the featured videos, trending videos, and other content sections.
- **watch.html**: This page represents an individual video player page, allowing users to watch videos and interact with comments and related videos.
- **subscribe.html**: This page enables users to subscribe to channels and manage their subscriptions.
- **settings.html**: This page provides options for users to customize their account settings and preferences.

### Routes

The following routes will be necessary for the application:

- **@app.route('/')**: The main route that displays the home page (index.html).
- **@app.route('/watch/<video_id>')**: This route handles the individual video pages (watch.html), where users can watch videos and engage with related content.
- **@app.route('/subscribe')**: This route displays the subscription management page (subscribe.html). It allows users to manage their subscriptions and explore new channels.
- **@app.route('/settings')**: This route leads to the user settings page (settings.html), where users can modify their account information and preferences.
- **@app.route('/search')**: This route enables users to search for videos, channels, and playlists. It displays a search results page with relevant content.
- **@app.route('/upload')**: This route allows users to upload their own videos (requires authentication and appropriate permissions). It handles the file upload and processing.
- **@app.route('/trending')**: This route displays a list of trending videos based on user preferences and engagement data.

### Additional Features

- **Bootstrap Integration**: Bootstrap is used for a consistent and responsive user interface across all pages.
- **Authentication**: Authentication mechanisms are integrated to allow users to sign in, create accounts, and manage their profiles.
- **Database Connectivity**: A database is used to store user data, video information, comments, and other relevant information.
- **Video Playback**: Video playback is implemented using HTML5 or other suitable technologies.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling is included to ensure a seamless user experience even in the presence of unexpected issues.
